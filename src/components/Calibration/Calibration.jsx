          <p className="h2_styles">What Does Analog Stick Calibration Do?</p>
          <article>
            Over time, analog sticks can develop <em>drift</em>,{" "}
            <em>uneven movement</em>, or <em>incorrect centering</em>, often due
            to wear or mismatched replacement parts.
            <br />
            <br />
            Calibration allows you to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                - <strong>Set the correct zero point</strong> — ensures the
                stick truly rests in the center when untouched.
              </li>
              <li>
                - <strong>Define maximum travel limits</strong> — adjust how far
                the analog moves in each direction.
              </li>
              <li>
                - <strong>Minimize deviations</strong> in new or replacement
                analogs.
              </li>
              <li>
                - Ensure the analog’s{" "}
                <strong>motion range forms a perfect circle</strong>, providing
                accurate input in all directions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Calibration can significantly improve centering and correct input
            mapping, and it can reduce apparent movement issues caused by
            incorrect sensor ranges or software offsets.{" "}
            <strong>
              However — true analog stick drift is a hardware fault (wear, dirt,
              or failing sensors)
            </strong>{" "}
            and usually requires cleaning or replacement of the joystick module.
            Calibration is an important diagnostic and adjustment step, but it
            does not repair worn hardware.

          <p className="h2_styles">Supported Controllers and Analog Types</p>
          <article>
            Our calibration tool supports all major PlayStation controller
            models and sensor types:
            <ul>
              <li>- PS4 DualShock analogs</li>
              <li>- PS5 DualSense analogs</li>
              <li>- PS5 Edge controllers</li>
              <li>- Hall Effect analog sticks</li>
              <li>- TMR (Tunnel Magneto-Resistance) analog sticks</li>
            </ul>
            Whether you’re using genuine Sony parts, upgraded Hall sensors, or
            next-gen TMR analogs, the calibration wizard ensures every type is
            properly aligned and responsive. Remember: calibration optimizes
            sensor mapping — it reduces software/offset issues but cannot repair
            mechanical wear that causes persistent drift.

          <p className="h2_styles">What Are Hall Effect Analogs?</p>
          <article>
            <strong>Hall Effect analogs</strong> use{" "}
            <strong>magnetic sensors</strong> instead of traditional resistive
            potentiometers. Because they have no physical contact between moving
            parts, they greatly reduce wear and are far less prone to developing
            drift compared to contact potentiometers.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Advantages of Hall Effect analogs:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>- Much lower risk of stick drift over time</li>
              <li>- Longer lifespan due to no friction</li>
              <li>- Smoother and more consistent movement</li>
              <li>
                - Excellent for players who demand precision and durability
              </li>
            </ul>
            While Hall sensors are much more resistant to drift, if you still
            notice persistent movement when the stick is idle, that indicates a
            hardware issue that may require cleaning or replacement —
            calibration alone may not solve it.

            What Are TMR (Tunnel Magneto-Resistance) Analogs?
          </p>
          <article>
            <strong>TMR analogs</strong> use{" "}
            <strong>tunnel magneto-resistance sensors</strong> to detect stick
            movement. Like Hall sensors, they work magnetically, avoiding
            mechanical wear, and often offer even greater precision and lower
            noise.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Benefits of TMR analogs:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>- Extreme sensitivity and accuracy</li>
              <li>- Low noise and stable output</li>
              <li>- Ideal for competitive or custom-modded controllers</li>
            </ul>
            TMR sensors are highly resistant to conventional drift problems, but
            if you observe constant unintended input, treat it as a hardware
            fault — cleaning or replacing the analog module is typically
            required.

          <p className="h2_styles">Easy Calibration Wizard – Step by Step</p>
          <article>
            The <strong>Calibration Wizard</strong> makes the entire process
            simple:
            <ol>
              <li>1. Connect your controller via USB.</li>
              <li>
                2. Open this page in Chrome, Edge, or another HID-compatible
                browser.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Follow on-screen guidance to adjust and confirm each axis.
              </li>
              <li>4. Save your calibration for ideal analog behavior.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            The wizard will help you set the center point and the maximum
            deviations so your analog stick’s movement draws a near-perfect
            circle. This improves accuracy and fixes miscalibration issues — but
            if drift persists after calibration, it is likely a hardware problem
            and you should consider cleaning the module or replacing the analog
            sticks.
