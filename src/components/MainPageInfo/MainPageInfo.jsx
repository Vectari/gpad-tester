        <h1>How to Fix Faulty Axes on a Gamepad</h1>
        <article>
          Axes issues, like joysticks drifting or not reaching their full range,
          can interfere with your gaming experience. Here&apos;s a step-by-step
          guide to fixing faulty axes on your gamepad: <br />
          <span>1.</span> Calibrate Your Gamepad: Before assuming there&apos;s a
          hardware issue, recalibrate the gamepad. Many systems offer built-in
          calibration tools to help realign your controller&apos;s axes. For
          Windows, go to “Devices and Printers,” find your controller, and use
          the calibration tool in the controller settings. <br />
          <span>2.</span> Clean the Joystick: Dust and grime can build up around
          the joystick, leading to drift or sticking. Use a cotton swab lightly
          dampened with isopropyl alcohol to clean the area around the joystick.
          Rotate the stick while cleaning to get into the edges. <br />
          <span>3.</span> Replace the Joystick Module: If calibration and
          cleaning don&apos;t fix the issue, the joystick&apos;s internal
          components might be worn out. You can replace the joystick module by
          opening the controller and soldering in a new one. Many third-party
          retailers sell replacement modules specifically for common gamepads.br{" "}
          <br />
          <span>4.</span> Update Firmware or Drivers: Sometimes, outdated
          firmware or drivers cause misalignments in the axes. Check if the
          gamepad has any available updates from the manufacturer and install
          them. <br />
          <span>5.</span> Test Again Using the App: After making these fixes,
          use the Web Gamepad Controller App to test the axes again. Move the
          joystick in all directions and check for proper range and accuracy on
          the screen.

        <h1>How to Fix Faulty Buttons on a Gamepad</h1>
        <article>
          Unresponsive or sticky buttons can ruin your gaming experience. Follow
          these steps to fix faulty gamepad buttons: <br />
          <span>1.</span> Clean the Buttons: Dust, dirt, or spilled liquids can
          cause buttons to become unresponsive or sticky. Open the controller
          (if it&apos;s user-serviceable), remove the buttons, and clean them
          thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol. Also, clean the contacts beneath
          the buttons on the circuit board. <br />
          <span>2.</span> Check for Wear and Tear: Gamepad buttons have rubber
          or plastic domes underneath that make contact with the board. Over
          time, these components wear down. If cleaning doesn&apos;t fix the
          issue, inspect these domes for damage and consider replacing them.
          Replacement button kits are available online for most common gamepads.{" "}
          <br />
          <span>3.</span> Re-solder Button Contacts: If a button press
          isn&apos;t registering at all, the contact points on the circuit board
          may be damaged or loose. You can try re-soldering the connections, but
          this step requires some technical skill. If you&apos;re not
          comfortable doing this, consider taking your controller to a
          professional repair service.
          <br />
          <span>4.</span> Update Firmware or Drivers: Button issues can
          sometimes be caused by outdated firmware or drivers. Make sure your
          gamepad is running the latest firmware, and check for updates for your
          system or game that might resolve any input issues. <br />
          <span>5.</span> Test Buttons on the App: After making these
          adjustments, reconnect your controller to the Web Gamepad Controller
          App to test if the buttons are now responsive. Press each button and
          verify that it registers correctly in the app.
